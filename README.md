This project includes implementation of a python program that uses the Huffman code to encode an English short story “To Build A Fire by Jack London” to find the code-words for each characters. The program will display a summary of the 
encoding process by printing various statistics such as the number of characters in the story along with their frequency of occurrence and their probability(We did not distinguish between capital and small letters, also we skip the “enter" character), also we find the average number of bits needed per character using Huffman, and the Entropy of the alphabet the we found the Compression ratio for Entropy to Huffman bits, also the total number of bits needed using ASCII encoding, percentage of compression Total number of bits needed using Huffman code compared to ASCII code, and code-word lengths of specific characters.
